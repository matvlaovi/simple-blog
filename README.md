# Welcome to the Simple Blog project!

This is a simple application that lists blog posts and allows you to display and create blog posts.

The project had a time limit and my main goal was to have a working application that does the job and hopefully looks clean enough.

# Features
- View all blog posts. Posts are paginated and can be retrieved in an increment of 10.
- View all the post details. Long titles and descriptions will not be hidden on this page.
- Create a post. Although the API does not support actual saving of the post on the server, this is a simple page that allows you to enter the title and body of a post and send a request.

# Future improvements
- Introduce state management with NgRx.
- Cleanup the styles and properly define all variables to be used across the project.
- Introduce some nice images and icons.
- Add some animations, stagger the additionally loaded posts.
- Add loading and error states.
- Finish the create form and implement the ability to define tags.
- Introduce Cypress into the application and cover the whole application with e2e tests.
- Add technical documentation.
- Integrate Sentry and track issues.
- Integrate Renovate and keep the dependencies updated.
